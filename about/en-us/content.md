This Geoportal was created by [Provita](https://www.provita.org.ve/) to make available to the general public a variety of geospatial data sources about Venezuela. Most of the information was created and developed within projects managed by [Provita](https://www.provita.org.ve/). For this reason, there is more detailed information about certain regions of the country, e.g., the Venezuelan Amazon. It also includes data from other national and international institutions which we consider important to provide.

We make this material available to be queried and downloaded, respecting the associated authors' copyrights. This will allow supporting the work of other institutions and users.

We hope that the information published on this site can be useful to many of you. Do not hesitate to [contact us](/contact) with any suggestions, comments or input.
