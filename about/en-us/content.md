This Geoportal was created by [Provita](https://www.provita.org.ve/) to make available to the general public a variety of geospatial data sources about Venezuela. Most of the information was created and developed within projects managed by [Provita](https://www.provita.org.ve/). For this reason, there is more detailed information about certain regions of the country, e.g., the Venezuelan Amazon. Additionally, we have included relevant data from other national and international institutions to complement the information.

The objective is that this material can be queried and downloaded, by the visitors of the geoportal, respecting the associated copyright; this in order to support the work of other institutions, researchers and general users.

We hope that the information published on this site can be useful to many of you. Do not hesitate to [contact us](/contact) with any suggestions, comments or input.
